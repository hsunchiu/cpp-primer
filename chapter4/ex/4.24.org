* Question:
Exercise 4.24: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass,
and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right
associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator
were left associative.

* Answer:
if the operator were left associative.
#+begin_src cpp
finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";
#+end_src 
would same as :
#+begin_src cpp
finalgrade = ((grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60)) ? "fail" : "pass";
#+end_src
if grade > 90, first conditional operator's result is high pass. so the finalgrade is always fail. It's contradictory obviously.
