* Question:
Exercise 4.23: The following expression fails to compile due to operator
precedence. Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you
fix it?
#+begin_src cpp
  string s = "word";
  string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ;
#+end_src

* Answer:
conditional expression have low precedence, so the line`string pl = s + s[s.size() -1] == 's' ? "" : "s"` equivalent to
`pl = (s + s[s.size() -1]) == 's'? "" :"s"`, the pl will always get empty string.
fix it with parenthesizing.
#+begin_src cpp
  string pl = s + ((s[s.size() - 1]) == 's' ? "" : "s")
#+end_src
