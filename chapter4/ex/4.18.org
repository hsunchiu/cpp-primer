* Question:
Exercise 4.18: What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?

* Answer:
#+begin_src cpp
  auto pbeg = v.begin();
  while (pbeg != v.end() && *beg >= 0)
    cout<<*pbeg++<<endl;
#+end_src

It will skip the first element, and access the off-the-end element(overflow).
