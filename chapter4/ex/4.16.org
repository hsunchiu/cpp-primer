* Question:
Exercise 4.16: Although the following are legal, they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.
(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
(b) if (i = 1024)

* Answer:
for (a), maybe we want to check the p is whether null, fix it:
(a) if ((p = getPtr()) != 0)
for (b), maybe we want to test whether i is equal 1024,fix it:
(b) if (i == 42)
