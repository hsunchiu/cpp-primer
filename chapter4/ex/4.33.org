* Question:
Exercise 4.33: Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following
expression does:
#+begin_src cpp
  someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y
#+end_src
comma have the lowest precedence. conditional is higher the comma.So
if someValue is true, we plus one to x and y, else substrate one to x and y.
