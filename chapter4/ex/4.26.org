* Question:
Exercise 4.26: In our grading example in this section, what would happen if
we used unsigned int as the type for quiz1?

* Answer:
here are 30 students in the example of this section. unsigned long have at least 32 bits on any machine. Thus, it is ensured that the bits start out with well-define values. The standard define that unsigned int is guaranteed to hold 16 bits. If unsigned int adopted, the result is undefined.
