* Question
Exercise 4.7: What does overflow mean? Show three expressions that will overflow.

* Answer:
Overflow happens when a value is computed that is outside the range of values that the type can represent.
#+begin_src cpp
  short svalue = 32767; ++svalue; // -32768
  unsigned uivalue = 0; --uivalue;  // 4294967295
  unsigned short usvalue = 65535; ++usvalue;  // 0
#+end_src
