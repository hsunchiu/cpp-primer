* Question:
Exercise 4.14: Explain what happens in each of the if tests:
if(42=i)
// ...
if(i=42)
// ...

* Answer:
for `if(42=i)`, the compiler will produce a error information.
for `if(i = 42)`, the expression will pass the compile, but will evaluated as true. because i = 42 and converted to bool `true`, because of nonzero.
