* Question:
Exercise 4.3: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

* Answer:
The world is full of bugs, It's just a trade-off. It doesn't matter as long as all the compiler vendors obey the same convention.(but it's boring if the world is all the same).
