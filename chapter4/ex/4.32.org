* Question:
Exercise 4.32: Explain the following loop.
#+begin_src cpp
  constexpr int size = 5;
  int ia[size] = {1,2,3,4,5};
  for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0;
       ix != size && ptr != ia+size;
       ++ix, ++ptr)  { /* ...*/ }
#+end_src

* Answer:
iterate the ia, get the ptr and index. if the ix and ptr are not out of the range of the ia, do something.
