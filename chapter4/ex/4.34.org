* Exercise 4.34: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what
conversions take place in the following expressions:
#+begin_src cpp
(a) if (fval)
(b) dval = fval + ival;
(c) dval + ival * cval;
#+end_src
Remember that you may need to consider the associativity of the operators.

* Answer:
(a) fval converted to bool, if fval is not 0.0, converted to true
(b) fval + ival, ival converted to float and the value of expression on the right hand `float` converted to double and assigned to dval
(c) cval promoted to int and the result is promoted to double, finally, dval add the result of the double(ival * cval)
