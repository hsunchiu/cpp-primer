* Question:
Exercise 4.35: Given the following definitions,
char cval;  int ival; unsigned int ui;
float fval;  double dval;
identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:
(a) cval = 'a' + 3;
(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
(c) dval = ui * fval;
(d) cval = ival + fval + dval;

* Answer:
(a) 'a' is promoted to int, the sum result is converted to char.
(b) ival promoted to float then * 1.0 , ui is converted float
(c) ui converted to float, then * fval, the result is converted to double then assigned to dval
(d) ival converted to float then plus with fval, the result is converted to double, then + dval, the final result is converted char.
