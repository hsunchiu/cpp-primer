* Quesiton:
Exercise 14.4: Explain how to decide whether the following should be class
members:
(a) %
(b) %=
(c) ++
(d) ->
(e) <<
(f) &&
(g) ==
(h) ()

* Answer:(TODO)

(a) symmetric operator. Hence, non-member

(b) changing state of objects. Hence, member

(c) changing state of objects. Hence, member

(d) = () [] -> must be member

(e) non-member

(f) symmetric , non-member

(g) symmetric , non-member

(h) = () [] -> must be member
