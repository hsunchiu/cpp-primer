* Question:
Exercise 14.34: Define a function-object class to perform an if-then-else
operation: The call operator for this class should take three parameters. It
should test its first parameter and if that test succeeds, it should return its
second parameter; otherwise, it should return its third parameter.

* Answer:
Maybe use template in the future.
#+begin_src cpp
  struct F{
    int operater()(bool condition, int a, int b){
      return condition ? a : b;
    }
  }
#+end_src
