* Question:
Exercise 14.11: What, if anything, is wrong with the following Sales_data
input operator? What would happen if we gave this operator the data in the
previous exercise?
#+begin_src cpp
  istream& operator>>(istream& in, Sales_data& s)
  {
    double price;
    in >> s.bookNo >> s.units_sold >> price;
    s.revenue = s.units_sold * price;
    return in;
  }
#+end_src

* Answer:
no input check. nothing happened.(but I think the maybe change some variable of the Sales_data was changed if the Sales_data is wrong)
