* Question:
Exercise 3.26: In the binary search program on page 112, why did we write
mid = beg + (end - beg) / 2; instead of mid = (beg + end)
/2;?

* Answer:
Because the interator of vector don't define the '+' operator between the two interators. beg + end is illegal. We can only use the subtraction between the two iterator.
