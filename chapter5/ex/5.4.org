* Question:
Exercise 5.4: Explain each of the following examples, and correct any
problems you detect.
(a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) {/ ** /}
(b) while (bool status = find(word)) { / * *  /}
if (!status) {/* * /}

* Answer:
(a) maybe want to test whether the iterator reaches the string's end. but the iterator is not initialized. fix it:
#+begin_src cpp
  string:: iterator iter = s.begin();
  while(iter != s.end()) { // do something}
#+end_src

(b) check whether could find a word, if found, do something, and continue. if not found , do another something.
