> The last example in this section that jumped back to begin could be better written using a loop. Rewrite the code to eliminate the goto

``` cpp
// backward jump over an initialized variable definition is OK
begin:
	int sz = get_size();
	if(sz <= 0){
		goto begin;
	}
```

use `while` to repalce `goto`

```
while(int sz = get_size()){
	if(sz <= 0){
		break;
	}
}
```
