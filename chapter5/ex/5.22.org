* Question:
The last example in this section that jumped back to begin could be better written using a loop. Rewrite the code to eliminate the goto

* Answer:
#+begin_src cpp
// backward jump over an initialized variable definition is OK
begin:
	int sz = get_size();
	if(sz <= 0){
		goto begin;
	}
#+end_src

use `while` to repalce `goto`

#+begin_src cpp
    while(int sz = get_size()){
        if(sz <= 0){
            break;
        }
    }
#+end_src
