* Question:
Exercise 5.1: What is a null statement? When might you use a null
statement?

* Answer:
A null statement is a single semicolon:
#+begin_src cpp
  ; //null statement
#+end_src
A null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the program’s logic does not.Such usage is most common when a loop’s work can be done within its condition. For example, we might want to read an input stream, ignoring everything we read until we encounter a particular value:
#+begin_src cpp
  // read until we hit end-of-file or find an input equal to sought
  while (cin >> s && s != sought)
    ; // null statement
#+end_src
