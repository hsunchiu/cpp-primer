* Question:
Exercise 5.18: Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems
you detect.
(a)
#+begin_src cpp
  do
    int v1, v2;
    cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
    if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
        cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
  while (cin);
#+end_src

(b)
#+begin_src cpp
  do {
    // . . .
  } while (int ival = get_response())
#+end_src

(c)
#+begin_src cpp
  do {
     int ival = get_response();
  } while(ival);
#+end_src

* Answer:
(a)promt user to enter two numbers and output the result of sum of the them. Error: miss the block scope.
#+begin_src cpp
  do {
    int v1, v2;
    cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:";
    if (cin >> v1 >> v2){
      cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
    }while(0);
  }
#+end_src

(b) Get the respsonse from some place and check the ival is valid .error: declaration in a do condition
#+begin_src cpp
  do {
    int ival = get_response();
    // ...
   }while(ival);
#+end_src

(c) same as (b), but the statement is correct.
