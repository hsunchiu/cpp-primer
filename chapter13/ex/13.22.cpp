/*
  Exercise 13.22: Assume that we want HasPtr to behave like a value. That
  is, each object should have its own copy of the string to which the objects
  point. Weâ€™ll show the definitions of the copy-control members in the next
  section. However, you already know everything you need to know to
  implement these members. Write the HasPtr copy constructor and copy-
  assignment operator before reading on.
