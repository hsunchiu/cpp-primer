* Question:
Exercise 13.8: Write the assignment operator for the HasPtr class from
exercise 13.5 in ยง 13.1.1 (p. 499). As with the copy constructor, your
assignment operator should copy the object to which ps points.

* Answer:
#+begin_src cpp
  class HasPtr {
  public:
    HasPtr(const std::string &s = std::string()): ps(new std::string(s)), i(0) { }
    HasPtr& operator=(HasPtr &lhs){
      this.ps = new std::string(*lhs.ps);
      this.i = lhs.i;
      return *this;
    }
  private:
    std::string *ps;
    int i;
  };
#+end_src
