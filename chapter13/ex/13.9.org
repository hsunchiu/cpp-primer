* Question:
Exercise 13.9: What is a destructor? What does the synthesized destructor
do? When is a destructor synthesized?

* Answer:
destructors do whatever work is needed to free the resources used by an object and destroy the
nonstatic data members of the object.The destructor is a member function with the name of the class prefixed by a tilde
(~). It has no return value and takes no parameters.

The compiler defines a synthesized destructor for any class that does not define its
own destructor. As with the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator, for
some classes, the synthesized destructor is defined to disallow objects of the type
from being destroyed. Otherwise, the synthesized destructor has an
empty function body.
