* Question:
Exercise 13.2: Explain why the following declaration is illegal:
#+begin_src cpp
  Sales_data::Sales_data(Sales_data rhs);
#+end_src

* Answer(copy from the book):
The fact that the copy constructor is used to initialize nonreference parameters of
class type explains why the copy constructor’s own parameter must be a reference. If
that parameter were not a reference, then the call would never succeed—to call the
copy constructor, we’d need to use the copy constructor to copy the argument, but to
copy the argument, we’d need to call the copy constructor, and so on indefinitely.
