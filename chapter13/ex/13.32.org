* Question:
Exercise 13.32: Would the pointerlike version of HasPtr benefit from
defining a swap function? If so, what is the benefit? If not, why not?

* Answer:
@Mooophy:
Essentially, the specific avoiding memory allocation is the reason why it improve performance. As for the pointer-like version, no dynamic memory allocation anyway. Thus, a specific version for it will not improve the performance.
