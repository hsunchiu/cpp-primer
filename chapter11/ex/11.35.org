* Question:
Exercise 11.35: In buildMap, what effect, if any, would there be from
rewriting
#+begin_src cpp
  trans_map[key] = value.substr(1);
  as trans_map.insert({key, value.substr(1)})?
#+end_src

* Answer:
- use subscript operator: if a word does appear multiple times, our loops will put the last corresponding phrase into trans_map
- use insert: if a word does appear multiple times, our loops will put the first corresponding phrase into trans_map
