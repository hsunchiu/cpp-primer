* Question:
Exercise 11.29: What do upper_bound, lower_bound, and
equal_range return when you pass them a key that is not in the container?

* Answer:
If there is no element for this key, then lower_bound and upper_bound will be
equal. Both will refer to the point at which this key can be inserted while maintaining
the container order. same as equal_range for the equal_range's return pair `first` and `second`.
