* Question:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Exercise 11.25: Contrast the following program with the one in the previous exercise
#+begin_src cpp
  vector<int> v; //Since the vector v is empty, the subsript operator [0] can not access v[0].
  v[0] = 1;//  Thus, the statement v[0] = 1; is meaningless.
#+end_src

Exercise 11.25: Contrast the following program with the one in the previous
exercise
#+begin_src cpp
  vector<int> v;
  v[0] = 1;
#+end_src

* Answer:
create an empty int vector, and want to set the first element' value to 1;
the compile will not check the over-bound, but a runtime error will arise.
