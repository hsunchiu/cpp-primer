* Question:
Exercise 6.46: Would it be possible to define isShorter as a constexpr? If so, do so. If not, explain why not.

* Answer:
No.

A constexpr function is defined like any other function but must meet certain restrictions: The return type and the type of each parameter in a must be a literal type

But std::string(parameter of isShorter) is not a literal type.
