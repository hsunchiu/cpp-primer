* Question:
It is a somewhat common mistake to define parameters that a function does not change as (plain) references. Doing so gives the function’s caller the misleading impression that the function might change its argument’s value. Moreover, using a reference instead of a reference to const unduly limits the type of arguments that can be used with the function. As we’ve just seen, we cannot pass a const object, or a literal, or an object that requires conversion to a plain reference parameter.

* Answer:
#+begin_src cpp
  int max(int i, int *pi){
    if (i < *pi)
      return *pi;
    return i;
  }
#+end_src
