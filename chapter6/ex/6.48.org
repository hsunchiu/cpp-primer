* Question:
Exercise 6.48: Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of assert:
#+begin_src cpp
  string s;
  while (cin >> s && s != sought) { } // empty body assert(cin);
  assert(cin);
#+end_src

* Answer:
read a word to s and check until the word is sought, then the status of cin, if cin  is not legal, exit the program.
It's not a good use of assert, because eof is a common condition.but assert will arise the program terminated.
