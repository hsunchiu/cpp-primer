* Question:
Exercise 6.18: Write declarations for each of the following functions. When you write these declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does.
(a) A function named compare that returns a bool and has two parameters that are references to a class named matrix.
(b) A function named change_val that returns a vector<int> iterator and takes two parameters: One is an int and the other is an iterator for a vector<int>.

* Answer:
(a)
#+begin_src cpp
  bool compare(const matrix &a,const matrix &b);
#+end_src
(b) 
#+begin_src cpp
  vector<int>::iterator change_val(vector<int>::iterator it, int v);
#+end_src
I think the question is not correct: How could I change value of the vector if we doesn't get the vector's other information.
#+begin_src cpp
  vector<int>::iterator change_val(vector<int> iv, int v);
#+end_src
