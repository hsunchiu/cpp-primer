* Question:
Exercise 6.14: Give an example of when a parameter should be a reference type. Give an example of when a parameter should not be a reference.

* Answer:
When memory is high const or must change the value of argument, `pass by reference` is a good idea.
#+begin_src cpp
  void swap(int &a,int &b);
#+end_src

When the argemunt doesn't be changed and the cost of paramenter's size is less than pointer's size,we can pass by value;
#+begin_src cpp
  int add(int a, int b);
#+end_src
