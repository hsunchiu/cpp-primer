* Question:
Exercise 6.31: When is it valid to return a reference? A reference to
const?

* Answer:
Whether a function call is an lvalue (ยง 4.1.1, p. 135) depends on the return type of the function. Calls to functions that return references are lvalues;
If the return type is a reference to const, then (as usual) we may not assign to the result of the call.
Principle:
Do not return reference of local object.
