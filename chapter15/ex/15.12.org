* Question:
Exercise 15.12: Is it ever useful to declare a member function as both
override and final? Why or why not?

* Answer:
I think is useful to declare a member function as both override and final, if the derived class is the last class which could be
inherited. At the same time, override key word will let the compile check weather the implementation is derived correctly, In that scene, we can think less.
