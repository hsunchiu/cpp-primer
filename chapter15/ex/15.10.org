* Question:
Exercise 15.10: Recalling the discussion from ยง8.1 (p. 311), explain how
the program on page 317 that passed an ifstream to the Sales_data
read function works.

* Answer:
the function takes a istream from which ifstream is derived. Hence the ifstream object "is a" istream ,which is why it works.
