* Question:
Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,
explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.
(a) std::cin >> int input_value;
(b) int i = { 3.14 };
(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
(d) int i = 3.14;

* Answer:
(a) before using a variable, we must define it. correct:
#+begin_src cpp
  int input_value;
  std::cin >> input_value;
#+end_src
(b) narrowing conversion in list initialization.(error, not warning) error: narrowing conversion required
#+begin_src cpp
  int i = {int(3.14)};
#+end_src
(c) `wage` is not defined.
#+begin_src cpp
  double wage;
  double salary = wage = 999.99;
#+end_src
(d) correct, but have the type conversion.
