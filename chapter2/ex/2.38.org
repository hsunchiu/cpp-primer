* Question:
Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction between
decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and
decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce
differing types.

* Answer:
auto will losing the top level information of type, decltype will not. decltype will keep the reference type and const.
For example:
#+begin_src cpp
  const int ci = 0, &cri = ci;

  auto a = ci;                    // a is an int
  decltype(ci) b = 100;           // b is an const int

  auto c = cri;                   // c is an int
  decltype(cri) d = ci            // d is a reference to const int
#+end_src
