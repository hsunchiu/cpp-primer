* Question:
Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine
whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or
low-level const applies in each case.

r1 = v2;
p1 = p2;    p2 = p1;
p1 = p3;    p2 = p3;

* Answer:
r1 = v2; //legal, assign const int v2 to r1(v1)
p1 = p2; //illegal, can't convert low level const pointer to nonconst
p2 = p1; //legal, converting low level nonconst  to const is legal
p1 = p3; //illegal, can't convert low level const pointer to noconst
p2 = p3; //legal, converting low level nonconst to const is legal
