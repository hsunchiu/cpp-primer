* Question:
Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a
reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand.
That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using
that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:
int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype(a = b) d = a;

* Answer:
a, b are int
c is an int
d is a reference to a

a = 3, b = 4, c = 3,  d is an alias for a, so d = 3
