* Question:
Exercise 2.29: Uing the variables in the previous exercise, which of the
following assignments are legal? Explain why.
(a) i = ic;
(b) p1 = p3;
(c) p1 = &ic;
(d) p3 = &ic;
(e) p2 = p1;
(f) ic = *p3;

* Answer:
Note: i is an int, ic is a const int, p1 is a pointer points to const, p2 is a const pointer points to noncosnt
p3 is a const pointer points to const
(a) legal, assign a const to a nonconst
(b) legal. p1 is noncast so it's assignable, p1 and p3 are pointer points to const.
(c) legal, p1 points to a const
(d) illegal, can't assign, because p3 is a const pointer.
(e) illegal, p2 is a const point and points to nonconst , but p1 points to const
(f) ic is a const, can't assign.
