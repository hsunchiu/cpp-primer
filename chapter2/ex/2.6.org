* Question:
What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:
#+begin_src c++
int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;
#+end_src

* Answer:
The first line's integer is decimal.
The second line:
1. int month = 09 is invalid, cause octal don't have digit 9.
2. day is octal.
