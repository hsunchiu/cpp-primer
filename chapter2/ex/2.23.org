* Question:
Exercise 2.23: Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object? If so, how? If not, why not?

* Answer:
We can't determine whether p points to a valid object. Because there is no way to distinguish a valid address from an invalid one formed from the bits that happen to be in the memory in which the pointer was allocated.
