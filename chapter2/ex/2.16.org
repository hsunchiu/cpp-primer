Exercise 2.16: Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If
they are valid, explain what they do.
int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
(a) r2 = 3.14159;
(b) r2 = r1;
(c) i = r2;
(d) r1 = d;

* Question:
(a) valid, assigns 3.14159 to which r2 refers, i.e.. to d
(b) valid, assigns i to d, type conversion occurs.
(c) valid, assigns d to i, type conversion occurs.
(d) valid, assigns d to i, type conversion occurs.
