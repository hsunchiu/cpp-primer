* Question:
What is the difference between `int`, `long`, ``long long`, `short`? What is the difference between `signed` and `unsigned`? What is the difference between `float` and `double`?
* Answer:
- int, long, long long, short , they are all integer.
  short take at least 16bit, int take at least 16bit, long takes at least 32 bit, long long take at least 64bit.
  at the same time. the length the type takes: int >= short, long >= int, long long >= long
- unsigned type always is bigger than or equal zero, signed type can express a value negative.
- float have 6 bit significant digit. double have 10 bit significant digit.
