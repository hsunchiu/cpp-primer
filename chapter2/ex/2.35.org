* Question:
Exercise 2.35: Determine the types deduced in each of the following
definitions. Once youâ€™ve figured out the types, write a program to see
whether you were correct.
#+begin_src cpp
  const int i = 42;
  auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i;
  const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;
#+end_src

* Answer:
j is int, k is a const int reference. p is a pointer to const int
j2 is const int, k2 is a const int reference for i
