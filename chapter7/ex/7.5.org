* Question:
Exercise 7.5: Provide operations in your Person class to return the name and address. Should these functions be const? Explain your choice.

* Answer:
#+begin_src cpp
  struct Person{
  public:
    std::string getName() const{
      return this-> name;
    }
    std::string getAddress() const{
      return this-> address;
    }
  private:  
    std::string name;
    std::string address;
  
  };
#+end_src
getName adn getAddress doesn't change the Object, so we declare and define them const.
