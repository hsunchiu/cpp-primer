* Question:
Exercise 7.52: Using our first version of Sales_data from ยง 2.6.1 (p. 72),
explain the following initialization. Identify and fix any problems.

Sales_data item = {"978-0590353403", 25, 15.99};

* Answer:
In my opinion ,the aim of the problem is Aggregate Class. Test-makers think that Sales_data is Aggregate Class,so Sales_data should have no in-class initializers if we want to initialize the data members of an aggregate class by providing a braced list of member initializers.

The initializers must appear in declaration order of the data members. That is, the initializer for the first member is first, for the second is next, and so on.

FIXED:
#+begin_src cpp
struct Sales_data {
    std::string bookNo;
    unsigned units_sold;
    double revenue;
};
#+end_src
