* Question:
Exercise 7.47: Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a string should be explicit. What are the benefits of making the constructor explicit? What are the drawbacks?

* Answer:
Whether the conversion of a string to Sales_data is desired depends on how we think our users will use the conversion. In this case, it might be okay. The string in null_book probably represents a nonexistent ISBN.

- Benefits:
prevent the use of a constructor in a context that requires an implicit conversion
we can define a constructor which is used only with the direct form of initialization

- Drawbacks:
meaningful only on constructors that can be called with a single argument
