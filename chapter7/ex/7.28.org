* Question:
Exercise 7.28: What would happen in the previous exercise if the return
type of move, set, and display was Screen rather than Screen&?

* Answer:
Had we defined move and set to return Screen, rather than Screen&, this
statement would execute quite differently. In this case it would be equivalent to:

#+begin_src cpp
  //if move returns Screen not Screen&
  Screen temp = myScreen.move(4,0); // the return value would be copied
  temp.set('#'); // the contents inside myScreen would be unchanged
  // so same as set and display
#+end_src
