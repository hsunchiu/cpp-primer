* Question:
Exercise 7.36: The following initializer is in error. Identify and fix the
problem.
#+begin_src cpp
  struct X {
    X (int i, int j): base(i), rem(base % j) { }
  };
#+end_src
* Answer:
the sequence of initialized rem depends on the result of base if the data member 's sequence is not different. Fix it: not initialize the data member by other data member
#+begin_src cpp
  struct X {
    X(int i, int j): base(i), rem(i % j){}
  };
#+end_src
