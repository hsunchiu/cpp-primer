* Question
Exercise 12.14: Write your own version of a function that uses a
shared_ptr to manage a connection.

* Answer:
From the book.
#+begin_src cpp
  void end_connection(connection *p) { disconnect(*p); }


  void f(destination &d /* other parameters */)
  {
    connection c = connect(&d);// use the connection
    shared_ptr<connection> p(&c, end_connection);// when f exits, even if by an exception, the connection will be properly closed
  }
#+end_src
