* Question:
Exercise 12.1: How many elements do b1 and b2 have at the end of this
code?
#+begin_src cpp
  StrBlob b1;
  {
    StrBlob b2 = {"a", "an", "the"};
    b1 = b2;
    b2.push_back("about");
  }
#+end_src

* Answer
After the last `}`, b2 will be out of the scope and be destroyed,so it meaningless to talk about how many elements b2 has. b1 has four elements.
