* Question:
Exercise 12.13: What happens if we execute the following code?
#+begin_src cpp
  auto sp = make_shared<int>();
  auto p = sp.get();
  delete p;
#+end_src

* Answer:
#+begin_src cpp
  auto sp = make_shared<int>();   
  auto p = sp.get();
  delete p;                       // the sp will be dangling shared_ptr(shared_prt sp have the reference count 1 to the dymatic memory, but the memory it pointed to have been freed.)
#+end_src
