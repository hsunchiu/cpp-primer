* Question:
Exercise 12.4: In our check function we didnâ€™t check whether i was
greater than zero. Why is it okay to omit that check?

* Answer:
because the i is `size_type`, means it's `unsigned`, the value of i is always greater than zero.
TODO:
I'm not sure it's okay or not to omit the check...:(.1.
