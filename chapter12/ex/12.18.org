* Question:
Exercise 12.18: Why doesnâ€™t shared_ptr have a release member?

* Answer:
shared_ptr doesn't need the ownership of transfer, all the shared_ptr pointed the same dynamic memory(not strict) has the reference count to control the free process, so it's not necessary to have release member.
