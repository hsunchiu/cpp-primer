* Question:
Exercise 12.5: We did not make the constructor that takes an
initializer_list explicit (ยง 7.5.4, p. 296). Discuss the pros and
cons of this design choice.

* Answer:(Just copy from the https://github.com/Mooophy and https://github.com/pezy. Thank them)
@Mooophy:

- keyword explicit prevents automatic conversion from an initializer_list to StrBlob. This design choice would easy to use but hard to debug.

@pezy:

Pros:

- The compiler will not use this constructor in an automatic conversion.
  We can realize clearly which class we have used.

Cons:

- We always uses the constructor to construct a temporary StrBlob object.
  cannot use the copy form of initialization with an explicit constructor. not easy to use.
