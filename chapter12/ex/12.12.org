* Question:
Exercise 12.12: Using the declarations of p and sp explain each fo the
following calls to process. If the call is legal, explain what it does. If the call
is illegal, explain why:

auto p = new int();
auto sp = make_shared<int>();
(a) process(sp);
(b) process(new int());
(c) process(p);
(d) process(shared_ptr<int>(p));

* Answer:
(a) it's legal.
(b) it's legal and after the process, the temporay int memory will be freed. It's  reasonable.
(c) it's legal, but after the process, the p will be a dangling pointer.
(d) it's legal. try to convert the type, but the type is same, it's not necessary.
