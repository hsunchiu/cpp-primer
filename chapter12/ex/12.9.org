* Question:
Exercise 12.9: Explain what happens in the following code:
#+begin_src cpp
  int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100);
  r = q;
  auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42),
  make_shared<int>(100);
  r2 = q2;
#+end_src

* Answer:
#+begin_src cpp
  int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100); // create a dymatic memory to store int 42, q the the point. same as r for int 100
  r = q;                                   // assign the value q to r, r q have the same pionter to int 42. memory leaks for 42
  auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42), r2= make_shared<int>(100); // q2, r2 is the shared_ptr, respectively pioint to 42, and 100.
  r2 = q2;                                                   // assign q2 to r2, r2 and q2 point to 32, memory for 100 will be freed, 32's reference will be changed to 2.

#+end_src
