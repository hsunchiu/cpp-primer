* Question:
Exercise 1.8: Indicate which, if any, of the following output statements are legal:
#+begin_src cpp
  std::cout << "/*";
  std::cout << "*/";
  std::cout << /* "*/" */;
  std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;
#+end_src
After youâ€™ve predicted what will happen, test your answers by compiling a program with each of these statements. Correct any errors you encounter.

* Answer:
the 3 and 4 line contain nested comment pair which causes syntax error.
