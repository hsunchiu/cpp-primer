* Question:
Exercise 1.6: Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
#+begin_src cpp
  std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
  << " and " << v2;
  << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
#+end_src
If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?
* Answer:
Not legal, in C++, an express with the end of `;` is a statement, there are three statements in the code. but `<< "and " << v2` can't be evalated.
we can correct the code like this:
#+begin_src cpp
  std::cout << "The sum of " << v1
  << " and " << v2
  << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
#+end_src
the C++ compile will consider the code a statement even if the code is separated by three line.
