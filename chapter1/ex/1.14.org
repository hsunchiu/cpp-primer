* Question:
Exercise 1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those
using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?


* Answer:
1. Advantange of 'for' and disadvantage of 'while':
  Locality, the variable in the scope of the loop.
  Pattern happens so often:using a varible in a condition and incrementing\
  that varialbe in the body.
2. Advantange of 'while' and the disadvantage of 'for':
  Clear when there is only one static conditon.
  Readable when the globle variables increamented in the body.
