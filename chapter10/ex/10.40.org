* Question:
Exercise 10.40: What kinds of iterators do you think copy requires? What
about reverse or unique?

* Answer:
Copy: input iterator(first and second parameter.) and output iterator(the second parameter).
reverse: bidirectional iterator.
unique: bidirectional iterator.(I think `unique` will resort the elements of the container, it's not good to use forward iterator to resort.)
