* Question:
Exercise 10.41: Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe
the operation that the each of the following library algorithms performs:

replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val);
replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val);
replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);
replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val);

* Answer:
replace(beg,end, old_val,new_val);
replace the elements of container from beg to end if the element is old_val, replace it to new_val.

replace(beg,end,pred,new_val);
replace the elements(when the pred is true) to new_val in the container from beg to end.

replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);
copy the elements in src contianer from beg to end to dest, and replace the element old_val to new_val;
(the src container doesn't change)

replace_copy_if(beg,end, dest, pred, new_val);
copy the elements is src container for beg to end to dest, and replace the element(when pred is true) to new_val.
(the src container doesn't change)
