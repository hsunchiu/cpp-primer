* Question:
Exercise 10.38: List the five iterator categories and the operations that each
supports.

* Answer:
| iterator categories    | supported operations                                                 |
|------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| input iterator         | Equality and inequality(`==`, `!=`)                                  |
|                        | Prefix and postfix increment(`++`)                                   |
|                        | Dereference operator(`*`), only on the right-hand side               |
|                        | Arrow operator(`->`) to access the member of the container.          |
| output iterator        | Prefix and postfix increment(`++`)                                   |
|                        | Dereference(*), only as the left-hand of an assignment               |
| forward iterator       | Forward iterators support all the operations of both                 |
|                        | input iterators and output iterators.Can move in only one direction. |
|                        | Multiple pass.                                                       |
| bidirectional iterator | Supports all the operators of a forward iterator, can read and write |
|                        | forward and backward.                                                |
|                        | Also supports prefix and postfix decrement(--) operator.             |
| random-access iterator | Supports all operators of bidirectional iterator. Moreover:          |
|                        | the relational operators(`<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`)                    |
|                        | Addition and subtraction operators(`+`, `+=`, `-` and `-=`)          |
|                        | The subtraction operator(`-`)                                        |
|                        | The subscript operator (`iter[n]`)                                   |
