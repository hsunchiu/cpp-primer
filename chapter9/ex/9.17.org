* Question:
Exercise 9.17: Assuming c1 and c2 are containers, what (if any)
constraints does the following usage place on the types of c1 and c2?
if (c1 < c2)

* Answer:
the class container must have the elementâ€™s '<' operator when design the class, and have the same type.

Both c1 and c2 are the containers except the unordered associative containers.(@pezy)
