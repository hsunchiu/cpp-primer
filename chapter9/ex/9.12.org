* Question:
Exercise 9.12: Explain the differences between the constructor that takes a
container to copy and the constructor that takes two iterators.

* Answer:
- constructor that takes a container: To create a container as a copy of another container, the container and element
types must match.
- with two iterators: When we pass iterators, there is no requirement that the container
types be identical. Moreover, the element types in the new and original containers can
differ as long as it is possible to convert  the elements weâ€™re copying
to the element type of the container we are initializing.
