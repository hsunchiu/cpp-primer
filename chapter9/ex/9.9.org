* Question:
Exercise 9.9: What is the difference between the begin and cbegin
functions?
* Answer:
begin return a common iterator which has write access, otherwise, cbegin return const_iterator have no access.
At the same time,  if we use `auto` to do type inference(since cpp11), we will get different iterator type.(Don't add `const` anymore)
