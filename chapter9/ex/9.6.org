* Question:
Exercise 9.6: What is wrong with the following program? How might you
correct it?
#+begin_src c++
  list<int> lst1;
  list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(),
    iter2 = lst1.end();
  while (iter1 < iter2) /* ... */
#+end_src

* Answer:
list<T> doesn't have `operator<` overload.
#+begin_src cpp
  list<int> lst1;
  list<int>::iterator iter1 = lst1.begin(),
    iter2 = lst1.end();
  while (iter1 < iter2) /* ... */
#+end_src
